/**
 * RBAC-backed nav-item gates for the Setup-mode sidebar.
 *
 * Each entry maps a sidebar href to a `{resource, action}` permission that the
 * user must hold. Items that should only appear for managers (i.e. anyone with
 * at least one direct report — Leader/PM/ZL/admin) carry `requiresReports: true`.
 *
 * The layout (server component) resolves this list into a `Set<string>` of
 * allowed hrefs via `computeAllowedNavHrefs()` and passes it to `AppNav`.
 * `AppNav` keeps the single source of truth for icons/labels/ordering and
 * just filters by membership in that set.
 *
 * The Operations-mode nav (`/home`, `/activities`, `/threads`,
 * `/notifications`) is universal for every authenticated user and is NOT
 * routed through this catalog.

 *   technically resolves to `[self]` for RP — that's a valid permission but
 *   the People page would show only their own row, so we hide the link.
