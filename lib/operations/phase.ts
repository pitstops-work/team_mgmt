/**
 * Phase derivation for the Operations world.
 *
 * The spine stores a centre's lifecycle implicitly in its goal's pitstops:
 * one-time setup pitstops (recurrence = None) run in an ordered sequence
 * (`progressTag`: Planning → Mobilisation → Setup → Capacity → Engagement →
 * Delivery → Monitoring), then recurring pitstops (Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly)
 * carry the ongoing review rhythm once the centre is live.
 *
 * The Operations UI needs to show, per centre, at a glance:
 *   - SETTING UP  → which phase it's in ("Infrastructure · 2/6")
 *   - LIVE        → it's operating; recurring-visit status is layered on
 *                   separately (needs this-period events, computed elsewhere)
 *   - DONE        → nothing outstanding
 *
 * This module derives that purely from a goal's pitstops — no new fields, no
 * DB access. Keep it side-effect-free so it can be unit-reasoned and reused by
 * any loader.
