/**
 * SYSTEM prompt assembly for the /recruitment scouting-desk generator.
 *
 * Previously a single hardcoded string in `app/api/recruitment/generate/route.ts`
 * that baked in the NGO/urban-settlement framing, the football metaphor, and
 * the NGO-flavoured flag rubric. Now assembled per request from a JD + Location
 * pair so the same pipeline can serve any role in any city.
 *
 * Composition (in order): base voice → theme block → JD block → rubric block →
 * scrutinise block → axes rule → output schema. Rubric fields on the JD exist
 * from Phase 1 but the prompt still injects generic defaults — per-JD rubric
 * wiring is Phase 3. Same for lockedAxes.
